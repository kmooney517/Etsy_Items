This assignment was built to test my understanding of:

array.forEach()
array.map()
array.filter()
array.reduce()
document.createTextNode()
.appendChild()

We were using a JSON formatted object of data from an etsy search provided to us.  The goal was to use the above methods in order to recreate a page with the given answers based on a .png image file.
